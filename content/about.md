Hey there! 👋

**I am Ayan Bag**, a pre-final year engineering undergrad student who loves to built and design products from scratch.

**Passion** and **diligence** are two traits that I believe most reflect me as an individual. It is my belief that this is the key to being successful in any endeavor that one set’s their mind. I love to generate new ideas and devise feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. I enjoy embracing the lessons learned from failure, stand up and continue to grow.
