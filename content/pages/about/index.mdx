Hey there 👋

**I am Ayan Bag**, a final year engineering undergrad who loves to built products from scratch.

**Passion** and **diligence** are two traits that I believe most reflect me as an individual. It is my belief that this is the key to being successful in any endeavor that one set’s their mind. I love to generate new ideas and devise feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. I enjoy embracing the lessons learned from failure, stand up and continue to grow.

**current status :** Final Year Undergrad (Ongoing 7th Semester) <br/>
