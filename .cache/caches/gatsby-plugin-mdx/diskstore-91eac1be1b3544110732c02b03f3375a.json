In 1947, a computer named \"Deep Blue\" defeated reigning world chess champion Garry Kasprov is a defining moment in the history of AI. But the great minds behind this computer started investing and publishing in this subject nearly six decades earlier. `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Alan Turing`}</strong>{` known as the father of theoretical algorithm and artificial intelligence is credited with provoking the investigation dating all the way back to the 1940s.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Games such as chess, tic-tac-toe, and Go are interesting because they offer a pure abstraction of the competition between the two armies and this abstraction makes games playing an attractive area for AI research.`}</p>\n    <p>{`However, this article will focus on one of the general decision-making strategy used by computers across a variety of strategic games, like Chess , checkers and many more.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This general-strategy is a widely used algorithm in game theory, called the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Minimax Algorithm`}</strong>{`.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`What is Minimax Algorithm ?`}</h3>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Minimax`}</strong>{` is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to choose an optimal move for a player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The theory behind the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Minimax Algorithm`}</strong>{` is that the algorithm's opponents will try to minimize whatever value the algorithm is trying to maximize. Thus, the computer should make moves which leaves its opponent capable of doing the least damage.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In ideal case i.e, the computer has infinite time and infinite storage capacity, the computer will investigate every possible outcome from the game current state as well as the path taken to reach the those states and assign those outcomes value. For a win-or-lose game like chess or tic-tac-toe, there are only three possible values-win, lose, or draw (often assigned numeric values of 1, -1, and 0 respectively)--but for other games like backgammon or poker with a \"score\" to maximize, the scores themselves are used. Then the computer evaluates which is the best possible outcome for the computer's opponents, starting bottom. By assuming that if the game state is reached, its opponent will make move which will lead to the opponent's best outcome which is the worse for the computer. Thus it knows its opponents future moves, and have a concrete idea of what the final state of the game will be if the second-last-position is reached. Then, the computer will treat that position of the terminal node of that value, even though it is not actually a terminal value. This process repeated a level higher, and so on. Ultimately, the computer has all the options available in which it can assign a value and the computer simply picks the highest value and takes action.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28982255/83515724-7975e880-a4f3-11ea-9630-a41f21d9a103.gif\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <h3>{`Coding an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI`}</h3>\n    <p>{`In our excecution of Minimax algorithm for building an AI to solve Tic-Tac-Toe, it works by visuallizing all future possible states of the board and constructs it in the form of a tree. When the current board is given to the algorithm i.e the roots of the tree, it splits into 'n' branches (where n denotes the number of move that can be choosen by the algorithm). If any of these news states is a terminal state, no further splits are performed for this state and it is assigned a score in the following way : `}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Score = +1 (if the computer wins)`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Score = -1 (if the computer loses)`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Score = 0 (if a draw happens)`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28982255/83522588-82b88280-a4fe-11ea-975e-44dd1a632214.png\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{`However if there is no terminal states, then each of this new states is considered as new roots and they give rise a tree of thier own. Being a 2 player game, player take turn alternatively, therefore whenever we go one level deeper in the network, we need to change the player which would be placed in one of the empty cell. By this way, we can visualize the moves of our opponent as result of our moves. The algorithm will evaluate the best move to be choose so that it will gain a maximum score when it is the computer's turn and the minimum score when it is its opponent's/human's turn.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The Code of Tic-Tac-Toe :`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-python\"\n      }}>{`# Import libraries\nimport sys\nimport random\n\n# This class represent a tic tac to game\nclass TicTacToeGame:\n\n    #
