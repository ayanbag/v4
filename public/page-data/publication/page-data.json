A large size image can take a lot of transmission time and storage. To reduce the transmission time and required storage without degrading the image quality, image compression algorithms are studied and applied. This paper proposes a new image compression algorithm that combines the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The image is first decomposed using the Singular Value Decomposition technique and then compressed by using the Fast Fourier Transform technique. SSIM and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio are used as performance metrics with the result of CT compression algorithm.\", mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"i\", null, \"Publication Date\"), \" : December, 2020\", mdx(\"br\", null)), mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, \"  \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347983766_Lossy_Image_Compression_Using_Singular_Value_Decomposition_And_Fast_Fourier_Transform\"\n  }), \"Research Gate\"), \"  \"))), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ayan Bag\"), \" et.al. \\\"\", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Real Time Facial Expression Recognition using Convolution Neural Network Algorithm\"), \"\\\" \"), mdx(\"details\", null, mdx(\"summary\", null, \"Abstract / Description\"), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"i\", null, mdx(\"b\", null, \"Abstract\")), \": The most expressive way human beings display emotions is through facial expressions. The task of detecting facial expression of a human being via a computer is a very complex process due to its variability present across human faces including color, expression, position, and orientation. The aim of this paper is to presents a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture for real-time facial expression recognition. We have used the ICML 2013 Facial Expression Recognition Challenge dataset for this study and then trained our neural network for emotion state classification. In this study, we achieved an accuracy of 84.18% and validation accuracy of 67.56% for the classification of seven different emotions through facial expressions.\", mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"i\", null, \"Publication Date\"), \" : September, 2020 \", mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"i\", null, \"Journal\"), \" : International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology (IJRASET)\", mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"i\", null, \"Volume\"), \" : 8\", mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"i\", null, \"Issue\"), \" : IX\", mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"i\", null, \"Pages\"), \" : 439-443\", mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"i\", null, \"ISSN\"), \" : 2321-9653\", mdx(\"br\", null)), mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, \"  \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"http://ijraset.com/fileserve.php?FID=31485\"\n  }), \"Journal\"), \" | \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://github.com/ayanbag/Facial_Expression_Recognition_Using_CNN\"\n  }), \"Code\"), \" | \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344286491_Real_Time_Facial_Expression_Recognition_using_Convolution_Neural_Network_Algorithm\"\n  }), \"Research Gate\"))), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ayan Bag\"), \" et.al. \\\"\", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"A Comparative Study of Regression Algorithms for Predicting Graduate Admission to a University\"), \"\\\" \"), mdx(\"details\", null, mdx(\"summary\", null, \"Abstract / Description\"), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"i\", null, mdx(\"b\", null, \"Abstract\")), \": Each year a large portion of students apply for graduate programs to further their education and get a deeper knowledge in their academic or career path. Universities usually consider many factors to choose between the pool of candidates. In this paper, we will be studying and analyzing these factors for graduate applications and give the probability of getting admission in that university, as output. We will be applying multiple regression models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to the data, and eventually, compare the models with the best score. In addition to the R-Squared Score, other performance error metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Square Error, and Root Mean Square Error are computed and showcased.\", mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"i\", null, \"Publication Date\"), \" : July, 2020\", mdx(\"br\", null)), mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, \"  \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343280957_A_Comparative_Study_of_Regression_Algorithms_for_Predicting_Graduate_Admission_to_a_University\"\n  }), \"Research Gate\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"\"))));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/publication"}}}
